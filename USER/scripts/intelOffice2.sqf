SUBJECT: Status Update: Lipova Lhota\n
\n
Command,\n
\n
The forward base at Lipova Lhota is operational and fully stocked.\n
The recent shipment of munitions has been distributed as instructed,\n
with additional reserves stored in the main depot. Patrol schedules\n
have been updated to account for increased traffic in the area.\n
\n
Our regional handler will arrive tomorrow to inspect the site.\n
Ensure all personnel are briefed and ready. Discreet coordination\n
with local sympathizers has been successfulâ€”no external\n
interference has been reported thus far.\n
\n
Priority Task: Begin preparing the southern approach for fallback\n
positions in case of emergency. Lipova Lhota must remain secure\n
until phase two is complete.\n
\n
Do not use this channel for further updates. Switch to\n
secure comms as of 1900 hours.\n
